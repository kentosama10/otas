# SVCI Research and Development Archiving System

The SVCI's Research and Development Archiving System is a capstone project dedicated to the creation of a digital platform for the systematic organization, storage, and retrieval of research and development (R&D) materials. The project aims to improve accessibility, efficiency, and cross-functional collaboration by incorporating advanced search features and intuitive user interfaces. It also ensures the preservation and security of intellectual property by implementing robust data protection measures. This system will foster a streamlined R&D process, enabling SVCI to harness its innovative potential to the fullest.
