Abstract


St. Vincent’s College Inc. (SVCI) research and development department produces a significant number of thesis papers every year. To address the challenges of manual and error-prone archiving, we propose SVCI’s Research and Development Archiving System, a web-based application that streamlines the process of storing and accessing thesis papers.
The system will be developed using the quantitative methodology to ensure that the system meets the needs and requirements of the end-users. The proposed system will have an administrator page, accessible only by research and development staff, where they can upload, manage and organize the thesis papers. Users will have access to a search function that allows them to easily locate thesis papers. The system will be designed to be user-friendly and customizable, with advanced search functionalities that include keyword search and filters.
The web-based application will be built using PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and HTML/CSS. The development process will involve the use of various software tools and technologies. The project will be evaluated based on its functionality, usability, security, and performance.
Upon completion, the proposed system will provide SVCI's research and development department with a reliable and efficient way of archiving thesis papers. It will enable staff to easily upload, manage and organize thesis papers, and provide an easy-to-use search function for users. Overall, this project represents a significant step forward for SVCI's research and development department, providing a modern and effective archiving system that will support the school's academic mission for years to come.
